                more easily connected with the data system and the artificial intelligence system. AM is based on the
                electric truck mature, high endurance on the superposition calculation of hardware, realization of
                mobile mining function. Electric vehicle technology is the core base of AM. AMU and partners control
                the complete electric vehicle technology, including, but not limited to: battery, motor, electric control,
                BMS system, T-BOX system, chassis technology and vehicle technology.</div>

                earth in accordance with the fluctuation of the electricity price. 4.0 industrial technology is the core
                essence of AM, ensure that future AM owners can get the most minimum time mining income, and
                the perfect vision of environmental protection. In iterative evolution, the 4.0 technologies that will be
                gradually involved in industrial 4.0 technologies include artificial intelligence, industrial robots, 3D
